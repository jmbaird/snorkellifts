Under the terms of the deal, Xtreme has acquired an initial 51% stake in a new company, Snorkel International Holdings (Snorkel), in exchange for agreeing to cause up to $50 million to be provided to Snorkel for working capital purposes and for other consideration, and Tanfield has acquired 49% in exchange for contributing substantially all of the assets of its Snorkel business division<\/h4>\n<p>Don Ahern, owner of Xtreme Manufacturing and Ahern Rentals, stated that \u201cSnorkel was founded in the USA and has a long, proud history in America. This is a strong brand, with an excellent product range and superb global distribution capabilities, making it a great fit with Xtreme. With the right strategic investment, Snorkel will regain its rightful position as a major player in the aerial lift market. We have a large number of Snorkel products in our own rental fleet at Ahern Rentals, as do many other independent rental companies. It is my desire to provide world-class aftermarket support and restore Snorkel\u2019s leadership in product development. Snorkel is an esteemed brand which has, throughout its long history, often been the standard of the industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Xtreme is a Nevada-based manufacturer of high-quality telehandlers, also known as rough terrain reach forklifts. These machines are widely used for lifting materials in the construction, mining, energy, and agricultural sectors. This agreement will enable Xtreme to make its full range of products and services available outside of the USA, in some cases marketed under the Snorkel brand.<\/p>\n<p>Ahern Rentals, Inc., is one of the largest companies in the U.S. equipment rental market and a longstanding customer of Snorkel. Ahern Rentals plans to offer direct sales of Snorkel machines and replacement parts as well as service and repair of Snorkel products from its 75 rental stores across 23 US states.<\/p>\n<p>Stockholders in The Tanfield Group Plc \u2013 which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange \u2013 voted overwhelmingly in favor of the deal with Xtreme. Under the agreement, all three of Tanfield\u2019s executive officers will join the Board of Snorkel International Holdings, while also stepping down from Tanfield\u2019s Board of Directors.<\/p>\n<p>Jon Pither, Chairman of The Tanfield Group Plc, stated that \u201cDon Ahern has a proven track record in the lifting equipment industry. I have every confidence that, with the help and support of the Snorkel management team, he will deliver a bright future for Snorkel.\u201d<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_date":"2013-10-15 05:00:32","post_name":"xtreme-manufacturing-acquires-majority-shareholding-in-snorkel","post_author":"admin_msk33zqs","post_status":"publish","featured_image":"https:\/\/snorkellifts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Xtreme-Manufacturing-Acquires-Snorkel.jpg","post_format":"standard","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_category":"Corporate News","post_tag":"","ekit_post_views_count":"137"},"6108":{"post_title":"Snorkel Lifts &amp; Xtreme Manufacturing Going \u2018Rock Solid\u2019 At World Of Concrete 2024","ID":"6108","post_content":"<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Las Vegas, NV (December 8, 2023) \u2014 Xtreme Manufacturing, LLC (Xtreme) and Snorkel International, LLC (Snorkel) are displaying a full spectrum of construction equipment at World of Concrete 2024 at Booth O30099 in the Silver Lot at Las Vegas Convention Center.

The lifts have fixed axles as standard, reducing complexity and risk of downtime. Oscillating axles are available as an option.<\/p>\n<p>Designed for a long working life, the new booms have an all steel construction, that includes a steel, 4-plate \u2018top hat\u2019 style boom weldment that is manufactured in Selma, California, durable steel cowling that has two individual steel doors on each side of the lift, in the traditional Snorkel-style.\u00a0 The turret offers 360\u00b0 continuous rotation, and delivers a constant 1.2m (47 in.) tailswing radius to prevent collisions when slewing the machine.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All components are \u2018in-board\u2019, meaning that they are protected from the elements, yet easily accessible for maintenance.\u00a0 A swing-out engine tray makes servicing easy, and steel fuel and hydraulic tanks provide additional durability in the field.\u00a0 An on-board diagnostics display provides plain text messages to assist with troubleshooting the lift, without the need for additional diagnostic tools.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Simplicity remains at the heart of Snorkel\u2019s design philosophy, and the new booms have open-loop hydraulics and CAN-BUS controllers for easier maintenance, service and training.

Designed for low-level construction and facilities maintenance applications, the Snorkel S3008P is an innovative push-around mini scissor lift, which provides a cost-effective\u00a0way to safely work at low level heights indoors.\u00a0 Capable of withstanding the demands of construction sites and the rental industry, the Snorkel S3008P can lift 500 lbs. (227kg) to a working height of 14 ft. 2 in (4.32m).<\/p>\n<p>Ahern Canada invited rental company attendees at the show to submit their business card at the booth, to be entered into a prize draw to win the Snorkel S3008P. Entrants had to be present at the prize draw to win, which took place at 1:30pm at the Ahern Canada booth.<\/p>\n<p>Brent Fillmore of Legacy Equipment in Edmonton was drawn as the lucky winner of the lift.\u00a0 Legacy Equipment operates a large rental fleet, supporting the requirements of construction industry in northern Alberta, with equipment and small tools.<\/p>\n<p>After the prize draw, Brent Fillmore said, \u201cI am thrilled to win the Snorkel S3008P mini scissor lift, and I think it will be a great addition to our fleet. Our team has had a fantastic time at the Prairie Regional Trade Show, and this is really a wonderful surprise. Thank you, Ahern Canada!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rhett Nickerson, regional sales manager for Western Canada for Ahern Canada, said, \u201cWe wanted to do something to mark our first time at this show in our Ahern Canada branding, and we thought what could be more valuable to a rental company than a piece of equipment, that will keep on giving through the rental return. The Snorkel S3008P is a strong product which appeals to a wide range of potential rental customers, and we are sure it will be put to work in the Legacy Equipment fleet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the Snorkel S3008P, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.aherncanada.ca\">www.aherncanada.ca<\/a>.

They also offer a specialist fleet of ultra-high platforms, under the BigLift division, which are commonly supplied to the wind power industry for turbine installation and maintenance.<\/p><p>Necip Ayhan, General Manager at Ayhanlar Platforms said, \u201cWe were introduced to the new Snorkel electric scissor lifts by Uzman Lift, and we were very impressed with the features that have been designed into the lift to lower the total cost of ownership. Uzman Lift were able to provide immediate delivery, and this has been followed up by a visit from a Snorkel product support engineer who came to train our technicians quickly after we received the lifts. We are very happy so far with the products and the service, and look forward to building this relationship.\u201d<\/p><p>Mehmet Karakaya, General Manager at Uzman Lift, added \u201cWe are very grateful to Mr. Ayhan and Ayhanlar Platform for this opportunity. We are committed to delivering the highest levels of customer service and I am pleased that we were able to support this request from stock. We are also grateful for the support of our partner, Snorkel.\u201d<\/p><p>Matthew Elvin, CEO at Snorkel, said \u201cI was honored to be welcomed to Ayhanlar Platform, and to be part of the handover of one of our largest deliveries into Turkey to date. On behalf of Snorkel, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Ayhanlar Platform for their investment, and to Uzman Lift for their continued hard work and dedication to the promotion of Snorkel in the Turkish market.\u201d<\/p><p>Following delivery, Snorkel provided technical training for the Ayhanlar Platform service engineers, equipping them with the skills to service, maintain and repair lifts for optimum performance within the rental fleet.\u00a0<\/p><p>For more information on Ayhanlar Platform, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ayhanlar.com\/en-us\/\"><strong>www.ayhanlar.com\/en-us\/<\/strong><\/a>.

It was there where they developed the \u201cHydra-Lift\u201d and eventually an industrial \u201cTruck Mounted Aerial Platform\u201d that became \u201cChicago\u2019s Snorkel No. 1\u201d fire truck. It became so popular that in 1959 Art resigned from Pitman to start his own company, \u201cSnorkel Fire Equipment Company.\u201d The story continues through the development of the company, leading to the eventual sale of Snorkel more than two decades later and the launch of Snorkel\u2019s first \u201cSnorkelift\u201d Aerial Work Platform in 1977.<\/p><p>After retirement, Art and his wife became \u201csnowbirds\u201d, traveling between their home in Pompano Beach, Florida and their summer home in Osage Beach, Missouri on the beautiful Lake of the Ozarks.<\/p><p>Art has been very happily married to his wife Sue for 22 years. He states, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written my memoirs without her help.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>\u201cMy Story\u201d is now available to order at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.artmoorememoirs.com\">www.artmoorememoirs.com<\/a>.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_date":"2016-02-22 12:33:54","post_name":"snorkel-debuts-tm12e-electric-drive-prototype-at-the-rental-show-2016","post_author":"admin_msk33zqs","post_status":"publish","featured_image":"https:\/\/snorkellifts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Snorkel-TM12E-lg.jpg","post_format":"standard","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_category":"Uncategorized","post_tag":"","ekit_post_views_count":"320"},"7168":{"post_title":"Snorkel Launches Electric Drive Telescopic Mast Lift And Material Lifts At The Rental Show 2017","ID":"7168","post_content":"<p><strong><em>Orlando, Florida (February 27, 2017)<\/em><\/strong><strong>\u00a0\u2013<\/strong>\u00a0Snorkel, a leading global manufacturer of aerial lifts, is launching the Snorkel TM12E electric drive telescopic mast lift at The Rental Show 2017.<\/p><p>Originally displayed as a prototype at The Rental Show 2016, the production-ready Snorkel TM12E is now available to order.\u00a0 The Snorkel TM12E features an efficient electric drive system that delivers longer duty cycles, a zero inside turning radius, and a new electric braking system.\u00a0 Capable of lifting up to 500 lbs.

Jonathan brings more than 20 years\u2019 experience to the role in prior operational and engineering capacities across multiple industries, including passenger rail operations and rail rolling stock manufacturing and engineering.<\/p><p>In his 22-year career, Jonathan has worked for Transdev Australasia (and Veolia Transport Limited prior to its acquisition by Transdev) in both their Auckland and Wellington operations in capacities including performance manager, operations manager, fleet controller, project engineer, general manager of operations, and acting chief operating officer. He has achieved records in the areas of safety, operational performance, and customer service. As general manager of operations for Transdev Wellington, he was able to exceed forecasted performance and earnings in 2020 despite the impact of COVID-19. Prior to his lengthy career at Transdev\/Veolia, Jonathan worked as operations manager for Bombardier Transportation where he oversaw operations management, productivity, scheduling, repairs and maintenance of stock, among other duties.<\/p><p>Jonathan also served for 11 years in the New Zealand Air Force as a qualified armament technician undertaking aircraft maintenance, component servicing, explosive store housing and accounting.<\/p><p>Of his new role, Jonathan said, \u201cI changed industries and joined Snorkel New Zealand as I was looking for a new challenge from a professional perspective. Snorkel is a well-known brand, and the opportunity to join a thriving company and contribute to its continued success was too good an opportunity to pass up. The locality of the business also enables me to work closer to home and spend more time with family.\u201d<\/p><p>Jonathan is looking forward to supporting the passionate Snorkel employees as well as the local industry and community while continuing to grow the Snorkel brand in New Zealand and supporting the growth of the business globally.<\/p><p>Matthew Elvin, CEO of Xtreme Manufacturing and Snorkel said, \u201cWe are excited to have Jonno join our team.

Equipped with maintenance-free lithium-ion battery packs with a built-in battery management system (BMS), the S2755RTE offers a true zero emission rough terrain solution, without compromising on the reliability and four-wheel drive capabilities of the diesel equivalents.<\/p><p>In both test conditions and real-life applications, the standard two battery pack system has been proven to deliver at least an eight-hour shift on a single charge, and in some cases, up to one week between charges, subject to usage. Unlike lead acid batteries, the charging pattern for lithium-ion batteries is designed to seamlessly fit into a normal working day schedule and can be top-up charged during breaks and shift changes.<\/p><p>Designed for outdoor applications, a powerful and efficient AC electric motor creates efficiencies in the hydraulic drive system with higher torque than a diesel engine, which in turn provides improved gradeability and enhanced performance on rough terrain than traditional combustion scissor lifts.<\/p><p>The electric motor also delivers up to 62% less jobsite noise than the diesel equivalent, enabling the lifts to be used indoors or in work environments with noise regulations, and with no engine fan, dust generation is reduced for safer and cleaner operation in low emission zones and green cities. With minimal battery and electrical system maintenance required, servicing costs are reduced by up to 93% when compared to an engine, while also eliminating the costs and risks of waste oil and filter disposal.<\/p><p>Alongside the Snorkel S2755RTE, Snorkel UK will be displaying a range of other electric products, powered by lead acid batteries.

Requiring zero maintenance, the battery packs have been tested in climatic chambers between -77\u00b0F (-25\u00b0C) and +140\u00b0F (+60\u00b0C), making them suitable for use in most environments.<\/p><figure role=\"group\"><img src=\"https:\/\/snorkellifts.com\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/Simple-to-charge%2C-the-new-A46JRTE-boasts-long-duty-cycles.jpg\" alt=\"The new Snorkel A46JRTE lithium-powered articulated rough terrain boom lift\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"789dfd88-1384-479c-ba0d-5975f074c8bb\" \/><figcaption>The new Snorkel A46JRTE lithium-powered articulated rough terrain boom lift<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Depending on usage, Snorkel lithium-powered mobile elevating work platforms are delivering extended duty cycles per charge, when compared to similar models. Based on typical use in rough terrain under test conditions, a single charge can last for more than one week, and in light use on elevation jobs with minimal driving, this increases to more than two weeks on a single charge.<\/p><p>Featuring a powerful AC electric motor, which creates efficiencies in the hydraulic drive system, the Snorkel A46JRTE benefits from higher torque, which results in increased traction and improved rough terrain performance. The electric motor also delivers 62% less jobsite noise and with no engine fan, dust generation is reduced for safer and cleaner operation in low emission zones and green cities. With minimal battery and electrical system maintenance required, servicing costs are reduced by up to 93% when compared to an engine, while also eliminating the costs and risks of waste oil and filter disposal.\u00a0 Less servicing also reduces the load on service engineers.<\/p><p>The original diesel-powered Snorkel A46JRT is a proven and globally popular articulated boom lift, known for its long working life and exceptional working envelope. Capable of reaching a maximum working height of 52 ft. 11 in (16.3m), the A46JRT has a working outreach of 24 ft. 11 in (7.35m) and benefits from a zero tailswing and 5 ft.

Built in the U.K. at Snorkel\u2019s facility in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and utilizing British manufactured lithium-ion batteries, the first two Snorkel S3970RTE\u2019s were recently delivered to Platform Hire and have been immediately deployed in their rental fleet. The decision to purchase the lifts was made after a successful demonstration in April by Snorkel UK Area Sales Manager, Scott Holtby, and is the first part of a larger order.<\/p><p>The Snorkel S3970RTE is the largest model in a new range of lithium-ion battery powered compact rough terrain scissor lifts. Reaching a maximum working height of up to 13.8m, the S3970RTE has a platform capacity of 350kg, and can be driven at full height. Measuring just 1.8m wide, this scissor lift can access confined spaces, yet features a spacious platform that can be extended up to 1.6m x 4.0m, and is available with non-marking, high grip tyres for indoor\/outdoor use.<\/p><figure role=\"group\"><img src=\"https:\/\/snorkellifts.com\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/Scott-Holtby-of-Snorkel-UK-%28left%29-provides-product-familiarization-to-the-Platform-Hire-team.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Holtby of Snorkel UK (left) provides product familiarization to the Platform Hire team\" width=\"488\" height=\"279\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"73021ad9-c6de-4083-81ce-0573d4536af0\" \/><figcaption>Scott Holtby of Snorkel UK (left) provides product familiarization to the Platform Hire team<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Powered by a 52V system incorporating two 5.75kWh lithium-ion batteries with integrated battery management systems, the S3970RTE is completely zero emission, yet delivers improved rough terrain performance over the diesel equivalent, thanks to additional power and torque via an AC electric motor and four-wheel drive hydraulic transmission.<\/p><p>A high frequency 50A on-board smart charger enables the lift to be fully recharged in up to 8 hours, but also allows for top-up charging such as during a break or shift changes. Depending on the application and usage, the S3970RTE can complete a full day\u2019s work on a single charge, and in some cases up to a full week. For heavier duty cycles or projects that require long-distance driving, the lift can be optioned with an additional 5.75kWh battery.<\/p><p>With more than 13 years\u2019 experience, Platform Hire are a leading specialist provider of mobile elevating work platforms, offering rentals, sales, training and more to their customer base. With their head office in Droitwich in the West Midlands and coverage provided nationally, Platform Hire also operate Platform Hire Racing in the British Superbikes championship, and provide aerial equipment to many race tracks around the U.K.<\/p><p>On the decision to be the first U.K. hire company to add Snorkel lithium-ion powered compact rough terrain scissor lifts to their fleet, Dave Williams, Managing Director of Platform Hire, said, \u201cI would like to thank Scott Holtby for working together with us on this project and enabling Platform Hire to be the first company in the country to offer these market-leading machines. The focus on reducing emissions and achieving net zero targets is increasing across the U.K., and we are seeing more large construction contractors discussing the need for zero and low emission equipment solutions. As a specialist in aerial equipment, we continuously monitor product developments and have been evaluating the new zero emission models for some time.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWe were impressed by the quality and reliability of the Snorkel lithium-ion battery solution during our trials. The fact that our customers can meet both emissions and noise regulations with a powerful rough terrain unit, without any compromise in performance when compared to a diesel unit is a real winner.<\/p><p>Additionally, when we calculated the savings in maintenance and fuel, even with a higher upfront purchase price, the return on investment is very attractive and we expect to see these units become very popular with our customers.\u201d<\/p><p>Andrew Fishburn, Managing Director, Snorkel UK, said, \u201cWe are delighted to deliver the first two units to Platform Hire, and thank them for taking this first step in bringing this technology to British jobsites. We know that the demand from the larger contractors already exists, and as the products become more widely available, this demand will grow across all types of aerial equipment users.\u201d<\/p><p>Platform Hire are already receiving positive feedback from their customers on the new Snorkel S3970RTE\u2019s. One of their first hires was to an existing customer for heating and air conditioning installation, who said, \u201cThe Snorkel S3970RTE was offered to us instead of our usual machines to try out and we were extremely impressed. It meant only hiring the one machine for jobs where we would usually have a diesel machine for outside and a smaller electric machine for inside. After two 12-hour shifts the battery indicated it still had 46% charge left!

Suitable for most environments, the lithium-ion battery packs have been tested in climatic chambers between -77\u00b0F (-25\u00b0C) and +140\u00b0F (+60\u00b0C).\u00a0These Snorkel models are offered as standard with two 5.75kWh lithium battery packs, and can be optioned with an additional 5.75kWh battery pack for extended range for very heavy use applications or where long-distance driving is required.<\/p><p>In both test conditions and real-life applications, the standard two battery pack system has been proven to deliver at least an eight-hour shift on a single charge, and in some cases, up to one week between charges, subject to usage. Unlike lead acid batteries, the charging pattern for lithium-ion batteries is designed to seamlessly fit into a normal working day schedule and can be top-up charged during breaks and shift changes.<\/p><p>Designed for outdoor applications, a powerful and efficient AC electric motor creates efficiencies in the hydraulic drive system with higher torque than a diesel engine, which in turn provides improved gradeability and enhanced performance on rough terrain than traditional combustion scissor lifts.<\/p><p>The electric motor also delivers up to 62% less jobsite noise than the diesel equivalent, enabling the lifts to be used indoors or in work environments with noise regulations, and with no engine fan, dust generation is reduced for safer and cleaner operation in low emission zones and green cities. With minimal battery and electrical system maintenance required, servicing costs are reduced by up to 93% when compared to an engine, while also eliminating the costs and risks of waste oil and filter disposal.<\/p><p>Matthew Elvin, CEO, Snorkel, said, \u201cWe are delighted to extend our proven lithium-ion battery solution to these five popular compact rough terrain scissor lift models.

Snorkel UK\u2019s Area Sales Manager, Jon Plaskitt handed over two Snorkel S3370BE and two Snorkel S3970BE scissor lifts to Banner Plant depot manager, Phil James, and provided familiarization training.<\/p><p>Available on all Snorkel narrow and compact rough terrain scissor lifts, Snorkel\u2019s innovative bi-energy power solution delivers the ultimate in jobsite and hire flexibility. The lift can be operated using its powerful combustion engine for outdoor activities, or be easily switched to DC battery power for quiet, zero emission electric performance for use indoors or in low emission zones. The lifts come equipped as standard with high grip, non-marking tyres to perform in all environments.<\/p><p>The Snorkel S3370BE reaches a maximum working height of 12m and can lift a maximum capacity of up to 450kg. The larger S3970BE can lift a platform capacity of 350kg to a maximum working height of up to 13.8m. Both scissor lifts measure 1.8m wide, and come with a 1.2m roll-out deck extension to maximize the working area, and have impressive four-wheel drive capabilities. Four hydraulic outriggers with automatic levelling come as standard, and benefit from Snorkel\u2019s innovative outrigger leg design, where the cylinder is inverted to protect the rod from damage when extended.<\/p><p>Of the recent delivery, Phil James said, \u201cThe bi-energy power solution from Snorkel is a great option as it can be used in many more applications than a standard diesel compact rough terrain scissor lift, ultimately increasing utilization opportunities.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cThis can either mean that a construction customer may keep the lift on hire for longer, using it on the jobsite from start to finish \u2013 on outdoors tasks initially, and then indoors for the final fit-out stages, or it could mean that we benefit from additional hire possibilities, such as in sensitive environments or low emission zones where the use of a combustion engine may be prohibited.\u201d<\/p><p>Banner Plant operates hire centres in Dronfield, Chesterfield, Derby, Leeds, Leicester, Rotherham and Ossett, and is headquartered in Dronfield on the outskirts of Sheffield. They offer a wide range of products and services for hire and sale, including plant, powered access, big air, power tools, accommodation and serviced toilets.<\/p><p>Gary Crofts, Sales &amp; Operations Director at Banner Plant added, \u201cCompact rough terrain scissor lifts are a popular choice for our hire customers, but we take pride in offering other variants, such as these bi-energy models, which can increase productivity or versatility in certain applications. These lifts are in addition to our already extensive fleet offering of low emission solutions that are available to our customers.\u201d<\/p><p>The four bi-energy scissor lifts were built at Snorkel\u2019s manufacturing facility in North East England, and feature Snorkel\u2019s dual-coat powder paint finish and are backed by a two-year parts and labour and five-year structural warranty as standard.<\/p><p>\u201cOnce again, we thank Banner Plant for their continued investment in Snorkel lifts.\u201d said Andrew Fishburn, managing director of Snorkel UK. \u201cThese bi-energy compact rough terrain scissor lifts are really an excellent choice for hire companies, and help to meet increasing emissions and noise regulations in certain areas and applications. Special thanks to Phil, Gary and the team. We\u2019re sure the bi-energy models will be a big hit at the Rotherham branch.\u201d<\/p><p>For more information on Banner Plant, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bannerplant.co.uk\/\">www.bannerplant.co.uk<\/a>.<\/p>","post_excerpt":"","post_date":"2021-03-16 12:28:00","post_name":"bi-energy-for-banner-plant","post_author":"admin_msk33zqs","post_status":"publish","featured_image":"https:\/\/snorkellifts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phil-James-Depot-Manager-Receives-Four-Snorkel-Bi-Energy-Scissor-Lifts.jpg","post_format":"standard","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_category":"Uncategorized","post_tag":"","ekit_post_views_count":"2"},"8728":{"post_title":"First Snorkel Scissors For FTH Hire","ID":"8728","post_content":"<p>FTH Hire Group have made their first investment in Snorkel\u2122 lifts, with their recent order of ten Snorkel scissors.<\/p><p>The mixed delivery included two Snorkel\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.snorkellifts.com\/equipment\/category\/Scissor-Lifts\/Electric-Scissor-Lifts\/S3219E\">S3219E<\/a>, four\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.snorkellifts.com\/equipment\/category\/Scissor-Lifts\/Electric-Scissor-Lifts\/S3226E\">S3226E<\/a>\u00a0and two\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.snorkellifts.com\/equipment\/category\/Scissor-Lifts\/Electric-Scissor-Lifts\/S4732E\">S4732E<\/a>\u00a0electric scissor lifts, plus two Snorkel\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.snorkellifts.com\/equipment\/category\/Scissor-Lifts\/Rough-Terrain-Scissor-Lifts\/S3370RT\">S3370RT<\/a>\u00a0compact rough terrain scissor lifts.
